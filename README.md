## :arrow_forward: How to Run App

1. `git pull`
2. cd to repo
3. `yarn`/`npm`
4. `pod install` in the `ios/` director
3. Run Build for either OS in top level
  * for iOS
    * run `npx react-native run-ios`
  * for Android
    * Run Genymotion
    * run `npx react-native run-android`
	
## To do

* API key is currently hardcoded for simplicity, but should be in an .env file (react-native-config set up already, `.env` file ignored)
* Merging pages not implemented, but the outline is there.
* Animate TextInput shake when search input is empty
* Loading sign
